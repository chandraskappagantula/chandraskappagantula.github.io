    <h2 class = "cen3">So what is Closinator?</h2>
    <p>As stated above, Closinator is a chatbot, which aims to eliminate low-quality posts across <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.
    Using certain algorithms, it reports posts to the <a href = "https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/227704/bot-room">dedicated chatroom</a>, and users can give feedback
    as to whether the post is low-quality or not. To participate, a basic knowledge of how Stack Overflow moderation works is needed. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class = "cen3">How does giving feedback work?</h2>
    <p>There are two types of feedback:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>TP</b>: This means the post is low-quality and as such are eligible for closure. Please see the rules for <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/help/closed-questions">when a post should be closed</a>.</li>
      <li> <b>LQ</b>: When a post is low-quality but is strictly <b><i>NOT</i></b> eligible for closure. If the post can be closed, use <b>TP</b> instead. We want to catch low-quality posts as well! </li>

    </ul>
