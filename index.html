    <h2 class = "cen3">So what is Closinator?</h2>
    <p>As stated above, Closinator is a chatbot, which aims to eliminate low-quality posts across <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.
    Using certain algorithms, it reports posts to the <a href = "https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/227704/bot-room">dedicated chatroom</a>, and users can give feedback
    as to whether the post is low-quality or not. To participate, a basic knowledge of how Stack Overflow moderation works is needed. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 class = "cen3">How does giving feedback work?</h2>
    <p>First and foremost, see the definition of <a href = "https://example.org">low-quality post</a> before reading how to give feedback. This is necessary. Aditionally, one must create an
    account with Closinator. See <a href = "https://example.org">Create an account</a> for more details on that. </p>
    <p>There are two types of feedback:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>TP</b>: This means the post is low-quality and as such are eligible for closure. Please see the rules for <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/help/closed-questions">when a post should be closed</a>.</li>
      <li> <b>LQ</b>: When a post is low-quality but is strictly <b><i>NOT</i></b> eligible for closure. If the post can be closed, use <b>TP</b> instead. We want to catch low-quality posts as well! </li>
      <li> <b>FP</b>: If a post is not low-quality and a post is not eligible for closure. This should be used for when a post is high-quality and can get good answers,
      and be useful for the site. </li>
      <li> <b>TPU</b>: This is the same feedback as TP, but this additionally sends a <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> request to the <a href = https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers>SOCVR (Stack Overflow Close Vote Reviewers)</a> chatroom.
      Please read the <a href = https://socvr.org/>FAQ</a> of SOCVR before sending a request! Some posts are not eligible to be sent as a request
      there. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Giving feedback does <i>not</i> require any privileges (other than an account), and you are free to give feedback at any time.
      However, if you see any user abusing the feedback system, their account will be destroyed by anyone with the proper privileges. </p>
